For the blackbelt extension I implemented the ability to move based on different percentages into the horse class. I added a new property to the horse class.
Now the horse class has an int percent property to represent its odds to move forward. 
The horse can be initialized with an int percentage argument now, it defaults to 50 percent. I also made a new method to set the percentage property.

The race class now sets the array of Horse objects to each have a random percentchance of winning.
